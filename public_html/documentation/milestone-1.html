            <p><strong>Persona:</strong><br/>Mike Smith</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>Mike is the IT manager of a medium-sized company. He has been tasked with creating a brand-new website to be deployed with the visuals from an ad-agency-conceived branding package that features a new customer focus. The current website uses PHP/MySql with a mix of dynamic pages and old static pages that were built with DreamWeaver, but the new site will use an industry-standard, modern toolchain.</p>
            <p>Mike uses his desktop work computer with its 4-monitor setup for almost all of his work-related tasks, as he works long hours and likes to leave his work at the office when he leaves for the evening.  Otherwise he uses an iPhone 12 Pro Max for occasional browsing and out-of-office email retrieval. While he uses all available browsers for compatibility testing, he favors Firefox for general browsing. His company subscribes to Microsoft 365 suite, including Outlook for email.</p>

            <p>Frustrations:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>The inconsistency of technology within the website has been a long-standing frustration, so Mike's boss sees this as an opportunity for a brand-new website that will be revealed as an integral part of the new branding release. It will use JavaScript exclusively, and Bootstrap for styling look/feel. Unfortunately, his current staff is somewhat unfamiliar with the application of these new techniques, so he is looking for someone with these skills to flatten the learning curve, and get this job finished inside the deadline he has been provided.</p>

        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>Mike receives daily push notifications from services like Indeed and ZipRecruiter for possible matches to an employee profile he filled out seeking a candidate with specific skills. My name appears in both emails, so he decides to visit my portfolio site.</p>

        <p>Goals:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
        <p>The goals of my personal portfolio site will be to present specific skills that Mike is looking for, and to let him know that I come with a host of related skills that most developers don't, which is ad agency, branding, and visual design experience. Having this additional experience will hopefully prove to be desirable to Mike, as I already understand branding and agency culture, so it will be easy for me to deliver product that conforms to the agency's style guide.</p>
