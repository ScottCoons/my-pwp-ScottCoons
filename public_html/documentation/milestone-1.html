            <p>Mike Smith, Age: 56.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-3 p-1 bg-warning">
            <p>Profession:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>Mike is the IT manager of a medium-sized company. He has been tasked with creating a brand-new website to be deployed with the visuals from an ad-agency-conceived branding package that features a new customer focus. The current website uses PHP/MySql with a mix of dynamic pages and old static pages that were built with DreamWeaver, but the new site will use an industry-standard, modern toolchain.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="col-3 p-1 bg-warning">
             <p>Technology:</p>
         </div>
         <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>Mike uses his Windows desktop work computer with its 4-monitor setup for almost all of his work-related tasks, and a MacBook Pro that he can switch into the monitor array when he needs to. Outside of work he uses an iPhone 12 Pro Max for occasional browsing and out-of-office email retrieval, and he'll take the MacBook Pro home on occasion.</p>

            <p>Attitudes and Behaviors:</p>
        </div>
    <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
        <p>Overworked, Mike has to manage his time wisely to be able to get any quality time with his family. He has established a large social media footprint and leverages it when he needs to find a new hire or contractor. He almost uses his network to recommend people, even though he uses job boards like Indeed and ZipRecruiter to find candidates also.</p>

    <div class="row g-1 bg-warning">
        <div class="col-3 p-1 bg-warning">
            <p>Goals:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>The goal of Mike Smith is to hire someone who can casually mentor the existing staff with the newer application of web technologies, while adding another set of eyes/hands on the project. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-3 p-1 bg-warning">
            <p>Frustrations:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-9 bg-warning">
            <p>Mike has a small core of developers who do the bulk of the work and are happy with their jobs.  It's the junior-level developers who tend to churn more than he'd like, and he isn't happy with how his boss gets too involved in the negotiation process when he wants to hire someone. He wishes he had more control over how much his staff is compensated.</p>
            <p>The inconsistency of technology within the website has been a long-standing frustration, so Mike's boss sees this as an opportunity for a brand-new website to be revealed as an integral part of the new branding release and marketing campaign. It will use JavaScript exclusively, and Bootstrap for styling look/feel. Unfortunately, his current staff is somewhat unfamiliar with the application of these new techniques, so he is looking for someone with these skills to flatten the learning curve, and get this job finished inside the deadline he has been provided. He's hoping he'll have the budget to hire someone with the right skill set.</p>

            <p>As a hiring manager, Mike wants to find a match to the job skills he wants in that candidate as soon as possible.</p>
